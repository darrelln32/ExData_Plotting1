1 - The file, "hh_data.txt", is a condensed file that just contains the data for dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02.  This file was used to build plots 2, 3 and 4.

2 - The PNG files for plots 2, 3 and 4 will have a grayish hue on them.  These plots were done using R instead of RStudio.  However, the files are readable.
